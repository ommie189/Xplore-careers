# Project Name:
Xplore-Careers

## Description
This is a career counselling application that helps the youth find career courses fit for them based on their interests. It works in such a way that the user does a quiz in one of the following fields of courses and is later given options of courses that the user can take.  
* Business
* Sciences
* Arts
* Engineering
This gives the user a narrower scope of what courses to look into thus achieving convenience.
